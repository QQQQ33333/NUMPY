# Python-Module-End-Assignment-Comprehensive-Assessment
##ACKNOWLEDGEMENT : I would like to express my special thanks to my mentor Ms.SIJI SATHEESHAN, who gave me the opportunity to do this assignment and also helped me to complete this work.

###As a culminating project, you'll be working with a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Your tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:
Analysis Tasks:
1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. 
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees. 
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

Importation of modules such as pandas,matplotlib amd seaborn.

Data set of company is read and take all the information about it.

Preprocessing the data set for data consistency and integrety.

###TEAM DISTRIBUTION : The no. of employees within each team and percentage split of employees in each team relative to the total no. of employees are found. A pie chart named "employee distribution by team" is added for easier findings.

insights gained

###SEGREGATED EMPLOYEES BY THEIR POSITION : The distribution of employees according to their position is analysed. A bar diagram is made for better realization.

insights gained

###PREDOMINANT AGE GROUP : The no. of employees belongs to a certain age group are counted. Based on that count, plotted a bar graph for better visualization.

insights gained

###HIGHEST SALARY EXPENDITURE : To findout which team and the position has the highest salary expenditure, generated a bar diagram by picking the top5 team with highest salary from the sorted data set according to their salary.

insights gained

###CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE AND SALARY : To investigate the correlation between age and salary, I chose the best option, that is scatter plot. From that visualization , I could surely gained the relation between them.

insights gained
